When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

As a back-up, or because you are pushing commits from different computers, or because you are collaborating on the repository with someone else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the remote changes immediately, as they may cause conflicts with your local changes. Seems like a good idea to finish your local changes first to a point of stability, then pull the changes and deal with the possible conflicts afterwards.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-Forks are a copy of someone else's repository. Can only be remote (online). Use this when you want to make changes to a repository when you don't have access to the original repository.
-Clones, although usually used to clone a remote (online) repository to a local one, it can also be used local-local (to make a copy of a repository in your computer to somewhere else in your computer). Use this for collaborating.
-Branches can be local or remote (online). These can be seen as a side track in which you can change code without changing the master branch. Use this for creating new features/bug fixes/experimenting, then add their content  to the master branch via merging.
