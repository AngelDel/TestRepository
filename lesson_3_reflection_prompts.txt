When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

As a back-up, or because you are pushing commits from different computers, or because you are collaborating on the repository with someone else.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want the remote changes immediately, as they may cause conflicts with your local changes. Seems like a good idea to finish your local changes first to a point of stability, then pull the changes and deal with the possible conflicts afterwards.
